// Requirements:

//# 1. Persist Data with Local Storage
//// Challenge: Store todos in the browser's localStorage so that the todo list persists even after refreshing the page.
//// Hint: Use useEffect to sync the todos with localStorage whenever they change.

//# 2. Drag and Drop for Reordering Todos
// Challenge: Implement a drag-and-drop feature to reorder the todo items.
// Hint: You can use the react-beautiful-dnd library or the HTML5 drag-and-drop API for this.

//# 3. Add Categories/Tags for Todos
//// Challenge: Allow users to categorize todos into different groups (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent). Add filtering functionality to view todos based on their category.
//// Hint: This can be achieved with an additional category field in each todo object and buttons to filter by category.

//# 5. Prioritization System
//// Challenge: Introduce a priority system (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to organize tasks. Sort todos by priority and visualize it with colors (e.g., red for High, yellow for Medium, etc.).
//// Hint: Add a priority property to your todo object and conditionally apply styles based on the priority level.

//# 6. Search Functionality
///// Challenge: Implement a search bar that allows users to search through their todo list by keyword.
///// Hint: You can filter the todos state based on the user's input and update the displayed list accordingly.

//# 7. Edit Inline
// Challenge: Allow users to double-click on a todo to edit its title directly, without needing to click an update button.
// Hint: You'll need to conditionally render an input field in place of the todo title when it's being edited.

//# 8. Dark Mode
//// Challenge: Implement a toggle switch to change the theme of the app to Dark Mode.
//// Hint: Use a state variable to store the theme and dynamically change the styles or CSS class based on the theme.

// # 9. Animate Todo Transitions
//// Challenge: Add animations when adding, deleting, or completing a todo to make the interactions feel smoother.
//// Hint: You can use the react-transition-group library for this or CSS animations.

//# 12. Todo Completion Percentage
//// Challenge: Display a completion progress bar that updates as todos are completed.
//// Hint: Calculate the percentage of completed todos and render a progress bar accordingly.
